To reset your root password, first log into your server with root privileges.

Start a Ruby on Rails console with this command:

gitlab-rails console production

Wait until the console has loaded.

There are multiple ways to find your user. You can search for email or username.

user = User.where(id: 1).first

or

user = User.find_by(email: 'admin@example.com')

Now you can change your password:

user.password = 'secret_pass'
user.password_confirmation = 'secret_pass'
user.unlock_access!

It’s important that you change both password and password_confirmation to make it work.

Don’t forget to save the changes.

user.save!
